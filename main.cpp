//?  [Problem Definition]
//*     Write a program that asks for the weight of the package and
//*     the distance it is to be shipped, and then displays the charges.
//*
//*  The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:
//*     Weight of Package (in Kilograms)          Rate per 500 Miles Shipped
//*        2 kg or less                              $1.10
//*        Over 2 kg but not more than 6 kg          $2.20
//*        Over 6 kg but not more than 10 kg         $3.70
//*        Over 10 kg but not more than 20 kg        $4.80
//*
//** Input Validation :
//* 	Do not accept values of 0 or less for the weight of the package.
//* 	Do not accept weights of more than 20 kg (this is the maximum weight the company will ship).
//* 	Do not accept distances of less than 10 miles or more than 3,000 miles.
//*     These are the company's minimum and maximum shipping distances.
